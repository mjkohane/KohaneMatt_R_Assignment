These are the only comments I have on your submission.

1. The Markdown file is an excellent example of how it should be written, I like that you have included instructions for changing directories and alternative code for some of the steps.
2. The only problem I could see with your repository is that you haven't pushed the plots from the data visualization part of the assignment.
